# ImageNet-trained deep neural network exhibits illusion-like response to the Scintillating Grid

This repository contains the image stimuli used for all analyses in the aforementioned paper along with all of the resulting output files (representational dissimilarity values across layers):
- "results" contains all output files; includes some files not used in the analyses
- "stimuli" contains the three sets of illusion, control, and natural/synthetic image stimuli
